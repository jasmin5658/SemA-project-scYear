      <h1>about me</h1>
      My name is Adam, I am a student at the Bezalel School of Art.
      I grew up in an artistic environment.
      I was born and raised in Jerusalem, Israel.
      As a child, I liked watching my grandmother while she was painting beautiful artworks that she would later show in exhibitions. Drawing was always a habit of mine to do instead of paying attention when I need to,
      but it’s only for the past year that I found myself practicing art with a different approach.
      As a way for me to truly express my thoughts, feelings and different visions that I have.
      So as a young artist exploring the tiny bits of life,
      I invite you to explore my website.
      Enjoy !
